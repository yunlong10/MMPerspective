## What is VidComposition?
> VidComposition is a novel benchmark crafted to evaluate the fine-grained video composition understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It focuses on assessing the ability of these models to interpret and analyze complex video compositions, where visual elements interact dynamically across time and space. VidComposition aims to bridge the gap in evaluating MLLMs by providing a detailed framework for understanding video content at a cinematic level. It comprises 15 intricate video comprehension tasks across five key areas of video composition.
