## What is MMPerspective?
> MMPerspective is a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the understanding of perspective geometry by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It comprises 10 diverse tasks across three key dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, with 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances.
